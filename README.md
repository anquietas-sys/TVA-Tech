Found on the workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3501380720

## Features

### Time Doors
The main feature of this addon are Time Doors. These glassy rectangles can transport you anywhere you desire.

### Wiremod support
The standalone Time Door entity supports wiremod inputs and outputs, letting you use them in your contraptions and dupes with style.

### Tempad
The Tempad is a device with the primary purpose of opening and closing linked Time Door pairs.
It has a menu where you can select a player or waypoint to travel to, customise the time door, or create a new waypoint.
At the bottom is a button to open a pair of Time Doors, with the entrance appearing at your crosshair.

### Persistant Waypoints and Customisation
Any waypoints or custom colors you set up in the Tempad will be persistant between servers.
Waypoints are seperated by map so each map can have different waypoints.

### Time Stick
This futuristic weapon is designed to violently rip your enemy from every thread of time and space, basically disintegrating them.
It will destroy any living thing, including NPCs and Players, as well as any prop or entity.
It will also destroy anything welded to a prop, allowing it to destroy entire contraptions.
